# Getting started

These instructions quickly get Spinnaker up and running, then walk you through
the steps of setting up and using Spinnaker to deploy to and manage clusters
on AWS and/or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

If you're interested in a set up for developers, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/blob/master/README.adoc) for
developer setup. 

For a container based alternative to this guide, please see: 
[docker compose](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/tree/master/experimental/docker-compose).

For the quick start, you will go through the following steps:

1. Set up a project representing your target deployment
environment. This project will house the clusters that are deployed
and managed by Spinnaker.
1. Set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Google Compute Engine instance
or local machine that will be used to run Spinnaker.
1. Configure an example Spinnaker pipeline to bake an image and deploy
the image to a cluster, and let you explore Spinnaker in operation.
1. When you're done experimenting, clean everything up and stop Spinnaker.

A [troubleshooting guide](http://spinnaker.io/documentation/troubleshooting.html) is available to walk through common problems. 

## Step 1: Set up your target deployment environment

You need to set up your target deployment environment, which is an AWS
or GCP project that will house clusters that are deployed to and
managed by Spinnaker. You can choose to deploy to only an [AWS
environment](#aws-setup), a [GCP environment](#google-cloud-platform-setup), or both. Please
follow the appropriate instructions below to get your target
deployment environment(s) set up.

### AWS Setup

If you'd like to have Spinnaker deploy to and manage clusters on AWS,
you'll need to have an AWS project set up. If you've already got one,
please skip to the next step. Otherwise, please follow the
instructions below.

Keep in mind that naming of your entities in AWS is important as Spinnaker will use them to populate available resource lists in the Spinnaker UI.

Sign into the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and let
AWS pick a default region where your project resources will be
allocated. In the rest of this tutorial, we'll assume that the region
assigned is <code>us-west-2</code>. If the region selected for your
project is different from this, please substitue your region
everywhere <code>us-west-2</code> appears below.

Also, in the instructions below, we'll assume that your AWS account
name is <code>my-aws-account</code>. Wherever you see
<code>my-aws-account</code> appear below, please replace it with your
AWS account name.

1. Create VPC.
* Goto [Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) > VPC.
* Click on **Start VPC Wizard**.
* On the **Step 1: Select a VPC Configuration** screen, make sure that
  **VPC with a Single Public Subnet** is highlighted and click
  **Select**.
* Name your VPC. Enter <code>defaultvpc</code> in the **VPC name** field.
* Enter <code>defaultvpc.internal.us-west-2</code> for **Subnet name**.
* Click **Create VPC**.

1. Create an EC2 role.
* Goto [Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) > AWS Identity & Access Management > Roles.
* Click **Create New Role**.
* Set **Role Name** to <code>BaseIAMRole</code>. Click **Next Step**.
* On **Select Role Type** screen, hit **Select** for **Amazon EC2**.
* Click **Next Step**.
* On **Review** screen, click **Create Role**.
* EC2 instances launched with Spinnaker will be associated with this
role.

1. Create an EC2 Key Pair for connecting to your instances.
* Goto [Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) > EC2 > Key Pairs.
* Click **Create Key Pair**.
* Name the key pair <code>my-aws-account-keypair</code>. (Note: this must match your account name plus "-keypair")
* AWS will download file <code>my-aws-account-keypair.pem</code> to
  your computer. <code>chmod 400</code> the file.

1. Create AWS credentials for Spinnaker.
* Goto [Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) > AWS Identity & Access Management > Users > Create New Users. Enter a username and hit **Create**.
* Create an access key for the user. Click **Download Credentials**,
    then Save the access key and secret key into
    <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> on your machine as shown
    [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files).
* Click **Close**.
* Click on the username you entered for a more detailed screen.
* On the **Summary** page, click on the **Permissions** tab.
* Click **Attach Policy**.
* Click the checkbox next to **PowerUserAccess**, then
  click **Attach Policy**.
* Click on the **Inline Policies** header, then click the link to
  create an inline policy.
* Click **Select** for **Policy Generator**.
* Select **AWS Identity and Access Management** from the **AWS Service** pulldown.
* Select **PassRole** for **Actions**.
* Type <code>*</code> (the asterisk character) in the **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** box.
* Click **Add Statement**, then **Next Step**.
* Click **Apply Policy**.

### Google Cloud Platform Setup

If you'd like to have Spinnaker deploy to and manage clusters on GCP,
you'll need to have a GCP project set up. If you've already got one,
please skip to the next step. Otherwise, please follow the
instructions below.

Sign into the [Google Developers
Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and create a
project. Call it a Project Name of <code>my-spinnaker-project</code> and
take note of the auto-generated Project ID (e.g. *powerful-surf-12345*).

1. Enable APIs in the <code>my-spinnaker-project</code> project.
  * Go to the API Management page.
  * Enable the [Compute
    Engine](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute_component/overview?project=_)
    and [Compute Engine
    Autoscaler](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/autoscaler/overview?project=_)
    APIs.

## Step 2: Set up a Spinnaker instance

In this step, you'll set up an instance of Spinnaker on AWS, GCP or on a local host.
We strongly recommend using a machine with 8 cores and at least 50GB RAM.

### AWS Setup

Create an AWS virtual machine.

1. Goto [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) > AWS Identity & Access
  Management > Roles.
* Click on **Create New Role**.
* Type "spinnakerRole" in the **Role Name** field. Hit **Next Step**.
* Click **Select** for the **Amazon EC2** service.
* Select the checkbox next to **PowerUserAccess**, then click
  **Next Step**, followed by **Create Role**.
* Click on the role you created.
* Click on the **Inline Policies** header, then click the link to
  create an inline policy.
* Click **Select** for **Policy Generator**.
* Select **AWS Identity and Access Management** from the **AWS Service** pulldown.
* Select **PassRole** for **Actions**.
* Type <code>*</code> (the asterisk character) in the **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** box.
* Click **Add Statement**, then **Next Step**.
* Click **Apply Policy**.
* Goto [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) > EC2.
* Click **Launch Instance**.
* Click **Community AMIs** then
* If the default region where your resources were allocated in [Step 1](#step-1-set-up-your-target-deployment-environment) is <code>us-west-2</code>, click **Select** for the **Spinnaker-Ubuntu-14.04-16 - [ami-5e06143f](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#launchAmi=ami-5e06143f)** image. Otherwise, consult {% include link.to id="ami_table" text="this region-to-AMI mapping table" %} to identify an appropriate image to use.
* Under **Step 2: Choose an Instance Type**, click the radio button
  for **m4.xlarge**, then click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.
* Set the **Auto-assign Public IP** field to **Enable**, and the **IAM
  role** to "spinnakerRole".
* Click **Review and Launch**.
* Click **Launch**.
* Select the `my-aws-account-keypair` you created earlier.
* Click **View Instances**. Make note of the **Public IP** field for
  the newly-created instance. This will be needed in the next step.
* Note that it will take several minutes for Spinnaker post-configurations to complete.

1. Shell in and open an SSH tunnel from your host to the virtual machine.
* Add this to ~/.ssh/config

          Host spinnaker-start
            HostName <Public DNS name of instance you just created>
            IdentityFile </path/to/my-aws-account-keypair.pem>
            ControlMaster yes
            ControlPath ~/.ssh/spinnaker-tunnel.ctl
            RequestTTY no
            LocalForward 9000 127.0.0.1:9000
            LocalForward 8084 127.0.0.1:8084
            LocalForward 8087 127.0.0.1:8087
            User ubuntu

          Host spinnaker-stop
            HostName <Public DNS name of instance you just created>
            IdentityFile </path/to/my-aws-account-keypair.pem>
            ControlPath ~/.ssh/spinnaker-tunnel.ctl
            RequestTTY no

* Create a spinnaker-tunnel.sh file with the following content, and give it execute permissions

          #!/bin/bash

          socket=$HOME/.ssh/spinnaker-tunnel.ctl

          if [ "$1" == "start" ]; then
            if [ ! \( -e ${socket} \) ]; then
              echo "Starting tunnel to Spinnaker..."
              ssh -f -N spinnaker-start && echo "Done."
            else
              echo "Tunnel to Spinnaker running."
            fi
          fi

          if [ "$1" == "stop" ]; then
            if [ \( -e ${socket} \) ]; then
              echo "Stopping tunnel to Spinnaker..."
              ssh -O "exit" spinnaker-stop && echo "Done."
            else
              echo "Tunnel to Spinnaker stopped."
            fi
          fi

* Execute the script to start your Spinnaker tunnel

          ./spinnaker-tunnel.sh start

* You can also stop your Spinnaker tunnel

          ./spinnaker-tunnel.sh stop

### Google Cloud Platform Setup

The quickest way to get a GCE instance running Spinnaker is to use Google's Cloud Launcher.

1. Navigate to [Spinnaker on Cloud
Launcher](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/solution/click-to-deploy-images/spinnaker).
* The displayed *Estimated cost* is for running the GCE VM for one
  month. GCE VMs are charged at minute increments with a 10-minute
  minimum.
1. Click the **Launch on Google Cloud Platform** button.
1. Select the project you selected in [Step
1](#step-1-set-up-your-target-deployment-environment) above and click
the **Continue** button.
1. Keep defaults and click the **Deploy Spinnaker** button near the bottom.
1. Install <code>gcloud</code>.
  * If you already have <code>gcloud</code> installed, you may skip this
    step. Otherwise, please follow the [gcloud installation
    instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).
1. When the deployment completes, open an SSH tunnel from your host to the GCE instance.
You can find the specific command in the **Suggest next steps** screen that appears.
  * Spinnaker may take a few minutes to configure itself. We suggest giving your instance 3-5 minutes
    for post-configurations to complete.

### Running Spinnaker on a host not on AWS or GCP

If you just want to try running on your local workstation, type in the following command:

    bash <(curl --silent https://spinnaker.bintray.com/scripts/InstallSpinnaker.sh)

The above [script](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/blob/master/InstallSpinnaker.sh)
installs and configures Spinnaker, and starts all Spinnaker
components, including Redis and Cassandra, which Spinnaker components
use to store data. If you see any errors, please just run the command
again.

It will take several minutes to install and configure Spinnaker along with
all of its dependencies. Once the install is complete, you will use your
web browser to interact with Spinnaker.  If you are running Spinnaker on AWS,
point your browser at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). Or, if
you are running Spinnaker on GCP, point your browser at
[http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

## Step 3. Configure example pipeline

To walk you through some of the basics with Spinnaker, you're going to
set up a Spinnaker pipeline that bakes a virtual machine (VM) image
containing redis, then deploys that image to a test cluster.

Note here that the us-east-1a availability zone is currently full, so it will need
to be deselected in the corresponding 'region' checkbox list for each of these
steps.

### Create a Spinnaker application

1. In Spinnaker, click **Actions** > **Create Application**
  1. Input <code>example</code> for the **Name** field and your email address for
the **Owner Email** field.
1. Click inside of the dashed rectangle beside the **Accounts** heading.
  * Click <code>my-aws-account</code> if you are deploying to AWS or
<code>my-google-account</code> if you are deploying to GCP.
1. Click on the **Consider only cloud provider health when executing
  tasks** button next to **Instance Health**.
1. Click the **Create** button.

### Create and configure a security group

Next, you'll create a security group that specifies traffic firewall
rules for the cluster. You'll configure the firewall rules to allow
all incoming traffic on port 80, for clusters associated with this
security group.

1. Click **SECURITY GROUPS**, then click the **+** button to create a security group.
1. Input <code>test</code> for the **Detail (optional)** field and
<code>Test environment</code> for the **Description** field.
1. If running on AWS, select **defaultvpc** as the **VPC** field and click **Next**.
1. If running on AWS
  * Click **Add new Security Group Rule**.
  * Click **default** on the **Security Group** dropdown.
  * Change **Start Port** and **End Port** to <code>80</code>.
1. If running on GCP
  * Click **Add New Source CIDR** and use the default
    <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> value for the **Source Range** field.
  * Click **Add New Protocol and Port Range**. Use the default
  <code>TCP</code> value for the **Protocol** field. Change **Start
  Port** and **End Port** to <code>80</code>.
1. Click the **Create** button.

### Create a load balancer

Next, you'll create a load balancer in Spinnaker.

1. Click **LOAD BALANCERS**, then click the **+** button to create a load balancer.
1. Input <code>test</code> for the **Stack** field.
1. If running on AWS, select **internal (defaultvpc)** from the **VPC
  Subnet** dropdown.
1. Click the **Next** button.
1. If running on AWS
  * Select **example-test** from the **Security Groups** dropdown.
  * Hit **Next**, then **Create**.
1. If running on GCP
  * Deselect the **Enable health check?** checkbox.
1. Click the **Create** button.

### Create a deployment pipeline

Your final task is to set up a Spinnaker pipeline. Let's name it
**Bake & Deploy to Test**. The pipeline will produce an image
containing the <code>redis-server</code> package and then deploy
it. In this tutorial, you'll trigger the pipeline manually.

To create the pipeline:

1. Click **PIPELINES**, then click **Configure** and select **Create
  New...** from the dropdown.
1. Input <code>Bake & Deploy to Test</code> for the **Pipeline Name**.
1. Click the **Create Pipeline** button.

#### Set up the first stage of the pipeline

You're now going to create the first stage of the pipeline. It will
build an image from an existing redis-server package.

1. Click **Add stage**.
1. Select **Bake** from the **Type** pulldown menu.
1. Input <code>redis-server</code> for the **Package** field.
1. Click **Save Changes**.

#### Set up the second stage of the pipeline

You're now going to set up the second stage of the pipeline. It takes
the image constructed in the *Bake* stage and deploys it into a test
environment.

1. Click **Add stage**.
1. Select **Deploy** from the **Type** dropdown.
1. Under the **Server Groups** heading, click **Add server group**.
1. Click the **Continue without a template** button.

1. Next, In the **Configure Deployment Cluster** window, input "test"
for the **Stack** field.

1. If running on AWS, select **defaultvpc** under **VPC Subnet**.
1. Click the **Next** button.
1. Click the text area next to the **Load Balancers** heading, then
  select <code>example-test</code>. Click the **Next** button.
1. Click the **Security Groups** form field, then click
  <code>example-test (example-test)</code>. Click the **Next**
  button.
1. If running on AWS
  * Click on the **Micro Utility** button to set the **Instance
    Profile**, then click **Next**.
  * Select the **Medium: m3** size, then click **Next**.
1. If running on GCP
  * Click on the **Micro Utility** button to set the **Instance
    Profile**, then click **Next**.
  * If running on GCP, select the **Micro** size, then click **Next**.
1. Input <code>2</code> for the **Number of Instances** field, then click the
  **Add** button.
1. Save the pipeline configuration by clicking the **Save Changes**
  button.

### Try it out!

1. Click **PIPELINES** in the navigation bar.
1. Click **Start Manual Execution** for the **Bake & Deploy to Test**
  pipeline.
1. Click **Run**.

Now, watch Spinnaker in action. A **MANUAL START** section will
appear, and will show progress as the pipeline executes. At any point
during pipeline execution, click on the horizontal bar to see detailed
status for any of the stages in the pipeline.

Feel free to navigate around the Spinnaker menus, create new
pipelines, clusters, server groups, load balancers, and security
groups, etc. and see what happens.

When you're ready to stop, don't forget to cleanup your resources. An
easy way to do this is to visit the pipelines, clusters, load
balancers, and security groups pages, click on the ones created and
select the appropriate **Delete** command from the Actions pulldown on
the right.

## Step 4. Stop Spinnaker

To stop Spinnaker, type:

    sudo stop spinnaker

The above command stops all Spinnaker components, including Redis and
Cassandra.
