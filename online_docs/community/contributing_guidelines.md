# Contributing guidelines

## Filing issues

Please file issues through the [Spinnaker GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues).

## How to Become a Contributor

This is normally the place where we'd tell you about Contributor
License Agreements and how you need to identify the right one and sign
it before you are able to contribute code to Spinnaker.

We'll probably end up doing something like this, but at the moment
we're exploring options that might make it easier for most of you to
contribute. Please stay tuned; we'll have updates here for you
shortly.

In the meantime, if you're really excited about contributing and don't
want to wait until we have all of this worked out, please reach out to
us on the [<code>#dev</code> Slack
channel](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/messages/dev). We really would love to
accept your patches!
